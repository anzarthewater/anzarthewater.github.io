<p1 > hey guys so like in my video i forgor some things <br>
<br>
1. basically, why it's out of the box? well you see, most books I read are stories, I would NEVER read anything that make me learn something useful, well maybe i do with some books, but like you get it, I don't read books, so like every book is somewhat out of the box for me, I feel like I didn't convey this enough to you in the flip 
<br>
and...
<br>
<br>
2. also, I can't really give you a brief explanation of my book, if i did I'd have to like teach you html and css because that's waht the book is about, but I'm not gonna do that, but basically the book teaches you about html, the code used to build websites, and css, the code used to style websites. website building is not hard, so you should learn it, it's really easym there's a lot of reasources, like this book by jon ducket, or w3 schools, bets website out there for learning, and it's free, unlike the book. Html is just tedious and takes a long time, as such with all coding. I'm kinda driving away from teh main point, brief summary? it teaches you about html and css in a relativly non-boring way. well you can look through this website by right clicking, source, and just look at teh html 

<br>
also...
<br>
<br>

there's a part in teh flip with jen j dumas may not like or approve, but I put in in anyways, and now I can't really get it out, but it'll proably get deleted tmr if it dosen't work out, it's not a bad thing. only 4 seconds. I can take it out, but gosh darn rendering sucks.
